In order to include a jar file in maven, that does not exist in the maven
 repository, we had to jump through some hoops.

The correct answer is specified here (this is a link to a specific answer):

### These were the steps required to make it work:

- Install homebrew. 
(homebrew was required to install maven)

- Install maven. 
(the copy of maven that comes with netbeans is not accessible from the command line)

- Use maven at the terminal to create a local repository inside the project 
folder, that contains the needed jar, and that specifies a group, artifact, 
and version name. 
This is the terminal command (need to make it one line again):
mvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=forms -DartifactId=forms -Dversion=1.0.6 
-Durl=file:./local-maven-repo/ -DrepositoryId=local-maven-repo 
-DupdateReleaseInfo=true 
-Dfile=/Users/bo/NetBeansProjects/TouchBoard/lib/forms-1.0.6.jar

- add these items to the project pom file:
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>local-maven-repo</id>
            <url>file:///${project.basedir}/local-maven-repo</url>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>forms</groupId>
            <artifactId>forms</artifactId>
            <version>1.0.6</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>


- you will also need this in the pom file, in order to generate a final
Jar file that can launch on double click and contains all dependencies.
