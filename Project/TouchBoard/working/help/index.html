<P>The purpose of TouchBoard is to help people type text, without having to press keys on their keyboard or click their mouse. The text that is typed can be sent to <I>any</I> other application that you wish. The application that receives the text is called the "target application". For example, the target application could be a program like Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on a Mac, or a form in a web browser.</P>

<P>One important thing to understand, is that the target application needs to have "focus" in order to receive text. If you click on TouchBoard for any reason, for instance to use TouchBoards menu, then the target application will lose focus. Just click on the target application to give focus back to it. This will allow the target application to recieve text from TouchBoard once again.</P>

<P>To activate a TouchBoard key or other TouchBoard controls, just hover over the key that you desire to activate. Hovering means to move your mouse over something and then stop, holding your mouse still for at least a moment. You do not need to click your mouse or use your keyboard, just hovering over a TouchBoard key is all that is needed. Controlling this program is easy, but it may take a little getting used to.</P>

<P>Any key you hover over will activate once, and it will not activate again until you move your mouse to a different spot. To activate multiple keys, repeat this process. When you do not want to activate any keys, move your mouse away from TouchBoard. You could also minimize TouchBoard if you won't be needing it for a longer time.</P>

<P>To display a <A HREF="#Board Explanation">board</A> and access its keys, hover over the boards name, or hover over the boards <A HREF="#Lock Explanation">lock control</A>. Hovering over a board name will display a board for a single key use. Locking a board with the boards lock control will display a board until you unlock it.</P>

<P>Hover over a <A HREF="#Key Explanation">key</A> inside of a displayed board to activate it. The key will send the text that it contains to the target application. You can try activating some keys now. Click inside the <A HREF="#Practice Area">practice area</A> above. Hover over the lock control next to one of the sample boards, and hover over some of the boards keys. You should see text from your chosen keys appear in the practice area if this is done correctly.</P>

<P>TouchBoard allows you to easily add your own boards and keys, or change existing keys. You can customize many things about a key, including it's name, background color, and it's contents (what it will type). A key can hold large amounts of text in its contents, there is no limit. Inside a key's contents, you can optionally use <A HREF="#Advanced Use and Command Codes">command codes<A> to do various things besides simply type text.</P>

<A CLASS="sup" HREF="#top">top</A></P>

<P>This program can benefit anyone who types. It is wonderful for helping you type faster and easier. It is also of great benefit to anyone who's wrists become sore from typing, or has any other difficulty with typing. TouchBoard can eliminate many keystrokes and mouse clicks, saving you lots of time, and also reducing physical wear on the tendons of the wrist.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B>Example uses:</B></P>
<UL>
   <LI><B>Memory aid</B>: Use it to store login names, or other pieces of text that are difficult to remember.</LI>

   <LI><B>Repetitive text</B>: Use it to store any text that is commonly repeated.</LI>

   <LI><B>Office or company environment</B>: Use it to store the names of companies or individuals, and automate any commonly needed typing.</LI>

   <LI><B>Online purchases and forms</B>: Use it to fill out your name, address, phone number, email address, and so forth on the internet. Fill out forms in seconds instead of minutes.</LI>

   <LI><B>Programmers</B>: Use it to type any common programming constructs, such as empty if statements, empty for loops, and template classes or files. Store variable names that you are currently working with in the Clips board for easy repetition.</LI>

   <LI><B>People with disabilities</B>: Use it to make it easier for you to type. Since this program does not require use of the keyboard or clicking of the mouse in order to enter text, it can be of great benefit to people who have difficulty doing either of those actions. Use it in conjunction with any device that allows a person to move the mouse pointer.</LI>

<P>Command codes can be typed into the contents of a key. Different command codes can make a key perform different actions. Commands allow you to make a key do more than just type text.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B>Basic command syntax:</B><BR>
Your commands will only work if you use the correct syntax, as follows:</P>

<P>1. Command code processing is turned off by default. To turn on command processing, type <CODE><A HREF="#Parse Command">[parse]</A></CODE> into every key that contains commands. The <CODE><A HREF="#Parse Command">[parse]</A></CODE> command does not have to be at the beginning of the contents, it can be anywhere inside of the contents. It can even be located after other commands, or at the end of the contents, if desired.</P>

<P>2. Spaces are not allowed in command codes. If you think you need a space inside a command code, use an underscore_ instead.</P>

<P>3. Command codes are always surrounded by square brackets. Remember, no spaces are allowed inside the brackets.</P>

<P>4. You may have as many commands in a keys contents as you wish.</P>

<P>5. Only certain commands exist to choose from. Undefined or misspelled command codes will generate an error.</P>

<P>6. Command codes are limited to 100 characters.</P>

<P>7. Command codes are case insensitive unless otherwise specified. Capitalize at will.</P>

<P>8. If a command ends in "x", you may type in a number to indicate how many repetitions of that command that you wish to have performed.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><A NAME="Parse Command"><B>[parse]</B></A><BR>
Use this to turn on command processing for every key that contains commands.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B>[leftbracket]</B><BR>
Types a left bracket "<CODE>[</CODE>".</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B>[rightbracket]</B><BR>
Types a right bracket "<CODE>]</CODE>".</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><A NAME="Up Command"><B>[up.x],</B></A><BR>
[down.x], [left.x], [right.x].<BR>
Press the up, down, left, or right arrow. Replace "x" with the number of times that you wish to have that key pressed.<BR>
<BR>
Examples:<BR>
<CODE>[down.1]</CODE>, press the down arrow one time.<BR>
<CODE>[right.30]</CODE>, Press the right arrow 30 times.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B>[backspace.x]</B><BR>
Press the backspace key the specified number of times.
<BR>See also: <CODE><A HREF="#Up Command">[up.x]</A></CODE> to learn what x means.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B>[delete.x]</B><BR>
Press the delete key the specified number of times.
<BR>See also: <CODE><A HREF="#Up Command">[up.x]</A></CODE> to learn what x means.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><A NAME="Camel Case That Command"><B>[camelcase_that]</B></A><BR>
This will copy any selected text into the clipboard, convert the text to camel case, and then paste the converted text over the existing selection. Camel case text looks like this: thisIsCamelCase.
Any white space characters are removed. Any dot characters ('.') are treated as the beginning of a new camel case phrase. This command may be useful to computer programmers, because variable names are often typed in camel case.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><A NAME="Capslock On Command"><B>[capslock_on]</B></A><BR>
This will turn on caps lock for TouchBoard. Caps lock will remain turned on for all keys until it is turned off. Caps lock causes all text to be typed in uppercase. The Caps Lock Key will indicate when caps lock is on or off for TouchBoard.<BR>
See also: <A HREF="#Caps Lock Key">Caps Lock Key</A></P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B>[capslock_off]</B><BR>
This will turn off caps lock for TouchBoard.<BR>
See <CODE><A HREF="#Capslock On Command">[capslock_on]</A></CODE> for an explanation of what capslock does.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B>[capslock_toggle]</B><BR>
This will turn on caps lock if it is off, and it will turn it off if it is on.<BR>
See <CODE><A HREF="#Capslock On Command">[capslock_on]</A></CODE> for an explanation of what capslock does.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B>[shift]</B><BR>
This will change the next letter to uppercase. It has the same effect as <CODE><A HREF="#Capslock On Command">[capslock_on]</A></CODE>, but for one letter only. If you use the shift command in a TouchBoard key without any text following it, TouchBoard will wait until more text is typed from some other key, and capitalize the first letter it encounters. What this means is that the letter that is capitalized can optionally be in a different TouchBoard key than the shift command. The shift command ignores tab, space, and return characters. The <A HREF="#Caps Lock Key">Caps Lock Key</A> will indicate when the shift command is in effect.<BR>
<BR>
Example:<BR>
<CODE>[shift]hello</CODE><BR>
This results in "Hello".</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B>[addclip]</B><BR>
This will add a new clip to the top of the clips board.
<BR>See also: <A HREF="#Add Clip Key">Add Clip Key</A></P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B>[pause.x]</B><BR>
This will pause key content execution for the specified amount of time. Time is specified in tenths of a second. The maximum length of a single pause is 10 seconds. The maximum total for all pause commands in a single key is 60 seconds.<BR>
Pause amounts over the 60 second limit are ignored.<BR>
<BR>
Examples:<BR>
<CODE>[pause.17]</CODE> will pause for 1.7 seconds.<BR>
<CODE>[pause.100]</CODE> will pause for 10 seconds.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B>[type_full_speed]</B><BR>
Touchboard has a typing speed setting, and this speed can be changed. This command sets the typing speed to the fastest possible speed. The typing speed set by this command can only affect the speed for the current TouchBoard key. The typing speed will change back to the default typing speed for the program when this TouchBoard key is finished. The default typing speed for the program can be set under <CODE><A HREF="#Options Menu Reference">Menu &gt; Options &gt; Default Typing Speed</A></CODE>.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B>[type_slow],</B><BR>
[type_slower], [type_slowest].<BR>
Touchboard has a typing speed setting, and this speed can be changed. These commands slow down the typing speed. Specifically, <CODE>[type_slow]</CODE> will type at 30 characters per second, <CODE>[type_slower]</CODE> will type at 15 characters per second, and <CODE>[type_slowest]</CODE> will type at 5 characters per second. The typing speed set by these commands can only affect the speed for the current TouchBoard key. The speed will change back to the default typing speed for the program when this TouchBoard key is finished. The default typing speed for the program can be set under <CODE><A HREF="#Options Menu Reference">Menu &gt; Options &gt; Default Typing Speed</A></CODE>.<BR>

Note: These commands slow down typing by creating a small pause between every keystroke. The maximum total pause time inside a single TouchBoard key is 60 seconds. The pauses created by these commands count towards that limit, and cannot exceed it. If the total amount of pause time reaches 60 seconds, any remaining text will be typed at full speed.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B>[press.key.key]</B><BR>
Use this command to press and release a single key, or a series of keys. You may use as many key codes as you want in this command, separated by periods, as long as the total length of the command inside the brackets remains no more than 100 characters. Key codes correspond to physical keys on your keyboard, not specific characters. <A HREF="references.html#Virtual Key Codes List">Click here for a list of valid key codes</A>. Each key listed is released before the next one is pressed, so this is not the correct command to use for <A HREF="#Press Combination Command">nested key combinations</A> like "control.c".<BR>
<BR>
Examples:<BR>
<CODE>[press.F4]</CODE><BR>
Press and release the F4 key.<BR>
<BR>
<CODE>[press.page_up.right.back_space.a]</CODE><BR>
Press and release the page up key, and then press and release the right arrow, and then press and release the back space key, and then press and release the letter 'A' key.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B><A NAME="Press Combination Command">[press_combination.key.key]</A></B><BR>
Use this command to create nested key combinations. Each key listed will be pressed and held in the listed order, and then released in the reverse of that order. You may use as many key codes as you want in this command, separated by periods, as long as the total length of the command inside the brackets remains no more than 100 characters. Key codes correspond to physical keys on your keyboard, not specific characters. <A HREF="references.html#Virtual Key Codes List">Click here for a list of valid key codes</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Examples:<BR>
<CODE>[press_combination.control.c]</CODE><BR>
Press and hold the control key, press and hold the letter 'C' key, release the letter 'C' key, release the control key. This combination copies text to the clipboard on Windows.<BR>
<BR>
<CODE>[press_combination.shift.1]</CODE><BR>
Press and hold the shift key, press and hold the number 1 key, release the number 1 key, release the shift key. This combination will type an exclamation point.<BR>
<BR>
<CODE>[press_combination.control.shift.escape]</CODE><BR>
Press and hold the control key, press and hold the shift key, press and hold the escape key, release the escape key, release the shift key, release the control key. This combination pulls up the task manager on Windows.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B><A NAME="Hold Key Command">[hold.onekey]</A></B><BR>
This will press and hold a single key. The specified key will be held down until you release that key with the <A HREF="#Release Key Command">release command</A>. The key will also be released if needed when the current TouchBoard key contents is done executing. Keys are not held down between separate TouchBoard key activations. Key codes correspond to physical keys on your keyboard, not specific characters. <A HREF="references.html#Virtual Key Codes List">Click here for a list of valid key codes</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Note: Most things that can be done with the hold and release commands can be done with other commands in a better way. It is recommended that hold and release only be used as a last resort, when no other commands are suitable.<BR>
<BR>
Examples:<BR>
<CODE>[hold.shift]Hello world![release.shift]</CODE><BR>
Produces the same effect as:<BR>
<CODE>[capslock_on]Hello world![capslock_off]</CODE><BR>
This would type in all caps "HELLO WORLD!"<BR>
<BR>
<CODE>[hold.control][hold.shift][press.escape][release.shift][release.control]</CODE><BR>
Produces the same effect as:<BR>
<CODE>[press_combination.control.shift.escape]</CODE><BR>
This combination pulls up the task manager on Windows.<BR>
<BR>
<CODE>[hold.control]c[release.control]</CODE><BR>
Produces the same effect as:<BR>
<CODE>[press_combination.control.c]</CODE><BR>
This will copy items to the Windows clipboard.

<P CLASS="noindent"><B><A NAME="Release Key Command">[release.onekey]</A></B><BR>
This will release a single key that was previously held down with the hold command.<BR>
<A HREF="references.html#Virtual Key Codes List">Click here for a list of valid key codes</A>.<BR>
See the <A HREF="#Hold Key Command">hold command</A> for more details.</P>

<P CLASS="noindent"><B>[date_time_stamp.format],</B><BR>
[date_time_stamp_lowercase.format].<BR>
These commands will generate a date and time stamp. The date and time will be taken from the computer's clock.<BR>
<BR>
Text case:<BR>
<CODE>[date_time_stamp_lowercase]</CODE> will type the date time stamp in all lowercase.<BR>
<CODE>[date_time_stamp]</CODE> will type the date time stamp in mixed case.<BR>
If you desire a date time stamp in all caps, it can be achieved with the following sequence of commands:<BR>
<CODE>[capslock_on][date_time_stamp.format][capslock_off]</CODE><BR>
<BR>
Format pattern:<BR>
Replace "format" with a date time stamp pattern. See the <A HREF="references.html#References and Date Time Stamp Patterns">date time stamp patterns section</A> for more details.<BR>
<BR>
Examples:<BR>
<CODE>[date_time_stamp.dMMMyy_ha]</CODE><BR>
Would result in "4Jul01 5p" if the computer clock was set to the Fourth of July on 2001 at 5pm.</P>
